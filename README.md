# Ambie v 1.0 for ARM (Windows 10 Mobile)

A modern Windows app that plays soothing tones to help you be healthier, happier, and more relaxed.

## Motivation

The motivation behind Ambie is to build a simple but beautiful soothing sounds player for Windows. 
Animations are used to enhance the experience. Only a few UI elements are available in the app. 
This is on purpose because for Ambie, _less is more_.

## Contributors

Pull requests are welcome! Please keep in mind the motivation behind Ambie, however: _Less is more_.
