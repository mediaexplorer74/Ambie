# Ambie - andromeda branch 

## About 
This is draft version of Ambie v 2.x.x.x for Windows Core Andromeda on Lumia 950

A modern Windows app that plays soothing tones to help you be healthier, happier, and more relaxed.

## Motivation

The motivation behind Ambie is to build a simple but beautiful soothing sounds player for some *special* Windows editions such as leaked Project Andromeda!
 
Animations are used to enhance the experience. Only a few UI elements are available in the app. 
This is on purpose because for Ambie, _less is more_.

## Contributors

Pull requests are welcome! Please keep in mind the motivation behind Ambie, however: _Less is more_.

### One more little thing 

My little plan is to adapt Ambie for "sdk 17314"... and research Andromeda compatibility :) 

I want to enjoy a little xaml fluent implementation. I hope, that after some time this funny mini-project could be continued... =) Cheers up!

As is. No support. RnD only. DIY.
