# AmbieX (Xamarin edition for Android, iOS, and Windows 10/Mobile)

A modern Windows app that plays soothing tones to help you be healthier, happier, and more relaxed.


## Motivation

The motivation behind Ambie is to build a simple but beautiful soothing sounds player for Windows. Animations are used to enhance the experience. Only a few UI elements are available in the app. This is on purpose because for Ambie, _less is more_.

## Contributors

Pull requests are welcome! Please keep in mind the motivation behind Ambie, however: _Less is more_. New sounds are greatly appreciated. New sounds must
- Have a license that can work with Ambie

### WARNING

Caution: this is my uncompleted work of porting early Ambie's version (master branch) and Experiment branch 
of famous Ambie Sounds tool onto Xamarin platform (with W10M support). 
Big problem: i don't undestand all tech. detals about MVVM pattern and some hard-level dependancy injection deals... 
But I sucsessfully switched Ambie project to 15063 os target =)

Best wishes,
