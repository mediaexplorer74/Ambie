## Motivation

The motivation behind Ambie is to build a simple but beautiful soothing sounds player for Windows. Animations are used to enhance the experience. Only a few UI elements are available in the app. This is on purpose because for Ambie, _less is more_.

## Contributors

Pull requests are welcome! Please keep in mind the motivation behind Ambie, however: _Less is more_. New sounds are greatly appreciated. New sounds must
- Have a license that can work with Ambie
- Have an image
- Have attributions for sound and image

### WARNING

Caution: this is my uncompleted work of porting Ambie Sounds onto Windows 10 Mobile OS. Big problem: grid "buttons" don't wont to be clicked... 
I think there are some GridView/ XAML control bugs appeared when I switch SDK to 15063 os target .
