# Ambie for Windows 10 Mobile

A modern Windows app that plays soothing tones to help you be healthier, happier, and more relaxed.

## Motivation

The motivation behind Ambie is to build a simple but beautiful soothing sounds player for Windows. Animations are used to enhance the experience. Only a few UI elements are available in the app. This is on purpose because for Ambie, _less is more_.

## Contributors

Pull requests are welcome! Please keep in mind the motivation behind Ambie, however: _Less is more_. New sounds are greatly appreciated. New sounds must

### WARNING

Caution: this is my uncompleted work of porting eraly build of famous Ambie Sounds tool (Ambie 0.8) onto Windows 10 Mobile OS. Big problem: grid "buttons" don't wont to be clicked... 
I think there are some GridView/ XAML control bugs appeared when I switch SDK to 15063 os target .
