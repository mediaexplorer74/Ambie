# FAQ

## Is it free to upload?

It's free to upload for now, but there are limitations to size of the file and the number of sounds you can upload. These limitations are ways to reduce server cost. We may add a paid tier in the future that allows for more sounds or larger sizes. 

## What files are supported?

Currently support `.mp3` and `.wav` files. Please create a GitHub issue if you want to request support for other formats.

## What's the review criteria?

All sounds uploaded to Ambie Catalogue will be reviewed. Our criteria is as follows
- Uploaded content must be a sound, not a song. Generally, if the sound file contains lyrics being sung by a person, it's a song. These will be rejected. However, there is some flexibility here, so if you are unsure about your sound, please email us at ambie_app@outlook.com and we can chat more about it.
- Appropriate sounds only. All sounds must be "Rated E for Everyone" and "Safe For Work". Sounds uploaded as a joke or to troll will be rejected, and your Microsoft Account may be banned from uploading.
- Sounds should be of reasonable length, at least 2 minutes. Exceptions can be made for sounds that loop perfectly even when under 2 minutes. Examples include the "Walking on snow" sound, which loops well due to the silence between steps.
- Sounds should have 3 to 5 second fade-ins and fade-outs to allow for smooth looping.

We will update this criteria regularly in response to feedback and upon new learnings.
