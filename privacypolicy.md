# Ambie - Privacy Policy 

## How We Collect and Use Information 

### Telemetry 
Ambie collects anonymous, aggregate telemetry. You can view Ambie's open source repository on GitHub to see all the areas where the app tracks telemetry. Examples include the number of times a sound is played or downloaded from the catalogue. This information is not personally identifiable. Telemetry is used to understand what parts of Ambie is being used or not used to help guide future work. This data is not used for marketing or sales. This data is not sent to any third party. 

You may opt-out of telemetry by going into Ambie's settings and turning off the Telemetry toggle. 


### Ambie Catalogue

Ambie Catalogue allows you to upload your sounds to our service, and lets other Ambie users download your sounds. Due to this nature, we store your uploaded sounds in our secure storage server, which is encrypted at rest. To keep track of which sounds you uploaded, we record a couple pieces of information about you on our server:
- Your non-identifiable ID (an ID given to us when you sign in with your Microsoft account that represents you).
- Your customizable username, if you provide one.

The data stored on our server is the bare minimum required to allow users to upload sounds to the Catalogue. The data stored on our server is not personally identifiable. We cannot determine who you are based on this data. None of the data is given to third parties. Also, none of the data is used for advertising or tracking purposes. If you do not want these data uploaded and stored on our server, please do not use Ambie Catalogue to upload sounds.

As part of our server's logging system, some network information such as your IP address may be logged as telemetry when you access our Catalogue service. For more information, see [Azure Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/data-retention-privacy).
